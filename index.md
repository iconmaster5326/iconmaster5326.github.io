Hello! This is the blog for Joshua Robbins (more commonly known as Iconmaster on the Internet). I'm currently working for [Grammatech Inc](http://grammatech.com). I post here about my new projects, my insights into computer science (especially with regards to programming languages and programmer tools), and probably stuff about video games, too. Enjoy!
